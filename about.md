Opinions expressed on this site are not those of my employer, or probably of
anyone's employer. This is my first Jekyll site other than some basic testing
to learn the system. I've been blogging with some kind of CMS or blog tool
for 15 years now, and I have to say the static site 'blog like a hacker' trip
is working well for me.

Privacy policy coming soon, but for now I don't collect info from you. GitHub
is hosting these pages, so it might, but I can't see any of it. No ads here.

I'm editing this site in Atom on a MacBook Air. I use Firefox with NoScript
and uBlock Origin. JPEG pictures you see were probably shot on my iPhone.

You can learn more about me on my [LinkedIn Page][li].
