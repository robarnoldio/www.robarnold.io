Today I learned that the photos app on Mac has the feature to copy and delete photos from your iPhone 
when the phone is USB tethered. This will make my photo management workflow quite a bit simpler,
plus clear up some space on the phone.

Maybe this is obvious, but I was surprised and a little delighted.
