Bottom line up front: you probably could use this [free service][link].

Here's the [signup page][link2].

What could you do with it? Here are some ideas based on how I use mine.

- Get familiarity with Exchange Online Protection. The policies are rather complex, so getting a sandbox where you can screw them up without irritating your users has a lot of value.
- See what is in the Defender for Identity SKU.
- Feel the awesome power of wielding Global Admin.
- Get to know the latest Office apps.
- Try out the M365 features your admin may have disabled.
- Play with Intune and Autopilot.
