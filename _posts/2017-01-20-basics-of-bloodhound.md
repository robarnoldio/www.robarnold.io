I had not previously heard of [BloodHound][basics], but I aim to give it a serious try
after reading this great writeup by the defense dude. Bloodhound maps your
Active Directory and shines a light on the riskiest things.

Why I like it: This is an article aiming to help you get started using a tool
effectively. And the impact of this tool is fantastic. Run it and you will
know your network, by which I mean see it though the eyes of your attacker.

Bonus: read what the creator of BloodHound has to say [here][intro].
