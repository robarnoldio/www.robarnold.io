Jordan Potti has a really useful writeup on using built-in Windows features to
do [incident response][basics]. I love articles covering the basics of
anything--there are so many more people who need that perspective. Thanks for
putting this together, Jordan.

Why I like it: An FBI agent I know talks about learning to "spot the weird."
This will get you started quickly at spotting the weird, and introduces a lot
of tools you may not be familiar with.
