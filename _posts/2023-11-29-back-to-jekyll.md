## Let's get started back up

Just a post to make sure my blogging workflow is still functioning. I want to post a bunch of stuff I've been learning about, but I need to blow the dust out of the Jekyll machine...

Stay tuned for some updates.

## Kind of a workflow

* open the folder for the site in VS Code
* create a new file under _posts
* copy some front matter from one of the other posts and tweak the dates (I wish this could be easier)
* barf out some content in Markdown format
* save the file locally
* fix stuff that the markdown lint complains about
* probably save it again
* go to source control and commit (with a spicy message)
* save all if necessary
* smash the sync changes button
* push commits with the little up arrow in the lower left

## gotchas

* file has to be .md extension
* timestamp in the front matter is relevant for visibility of the post
