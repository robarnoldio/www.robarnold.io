Rob Graham drops a serious brain dump of command line (bash) kung fu in
[this lengthy post][basics]. Not just what to do, but why. I learned a lot of
this in my days of FreeBSD administration, but several of these are newer tools
and capabilities(we didn't do a lot of JSON parsing back then--XML was the new
hotness).

Why I like it: I love basics. This is a box set of greatest hits from the basics
of system administration and general bash skills.

Bonus: "There’s no wrong answer as to which editor to use, unless that answer
is ‘emacs’."
