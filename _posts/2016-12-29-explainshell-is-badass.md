Probably you get a snippet and paste it in your shell and see what happens.

Depending on your level of familiarity, you may know what is going to happen,
or at least think you know.

[Explainshell][link] will show you in copious detail what the thing does, including
each of the switches to the commands. Now there's little reason not to
understand before you type that command in your shell.
