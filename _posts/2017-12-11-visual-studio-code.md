I have now converted to using [Visual Studio Code][VSCode] for my editor (was using Atom). I very much
like the git integration, and the extensible nature of the editor. I'm not an expert--I've probably put 
in more hours with vi (not vim) and Ultra-Edit 32 than any other text editors/IDEs.

VS Code seems good at staying out of my way but also making frequent workflows easy. I'm still learning
the git features, but it's nice to be able to stage, commit, and push without leaving the IDE. If Atom
did that, I never found out how.

VS Code is a free tool but it has huge value. Try it out if you are open to a new text editor/IDE.
