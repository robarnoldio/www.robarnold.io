Conclusion: they are good--get a couple. 

I recently spent an afternoon enabling several of my online accounts to use U2F. I bought several 
[Yubikeys][yubikey] and wanted to get some experience with using them day to day. I have previously used Duo
and currently use RSA soft token for work. I currently use Google Authenticator for some of my personal 
accounts. I find the U2F experience fairly unobtrusive, as long as you use Chrome, which I 
recently switched to.

One side effect of setting up and going through this: it gives you the opportunity to review and consider the
security posture of your various online accounts. Things to think about: are my recovery emails and phone numbers 
current? Are they the ones I'd prefer? Do I understand what I need to do to recover if I lost this account?

Some things to consider: Buy two keys at minimum--you want a backup. There's a minor additional inconvenience 
(a separate download) if you don't run Chrome, but they will still work. I haven't gone through that process.
You may need to consider your machine's port configuration--USB-A is becoming scarcer, but Yubico has
models that use USB-C. It's just the cheapest one is USB-A only right now.

I don't carry a lot of keys on my ring anymore, so adding this to Every Day Carry wasn't a problem. They have a
nano form factor, but that seems too easily lost for me. I expect the main failure mode to be losing the key.
